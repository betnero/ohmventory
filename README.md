# ohmventory
Electronic component inventory management.

Designed for local ad-hoc use. 
Not secure enough to be placed on a public server (may introduce vulnerabilities).

What the app currently does:

Views all components
Searches for components (by many fields including tags, name, type, etc.)
Adds a new component (with validation for required fields and duplicate ID check)
Updates an existing component
Deletes a component
Serves an index.html as a basic front page
